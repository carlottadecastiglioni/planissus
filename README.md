# Project Overview

Planissus is a simulation game that models the interactions between different species in an ecosystem. The game incorporates elements of population dynamics, resource management, and competition to create an engaging and evolving environment.

# Rules & Mechanics

The game involves multiple entities, including:

Erbasts: Herbivores that feed on vegetation.

Carvizes: Predators that hunt erbasts.

Vegetobs: The primary food source for erbasts.

Earth and Water Cells: Different terrain types that influence movement and survival.

The ecosystem evolves over time based on predefined behaviors such as movement, growth, predation, and reproduction. Each entity has unique characteristics such as energy levels, lifetime, and social behavior, affecting its survival and interactions.

# Note on Game Rules
This was a project for the programming exam in my university. There are specific rules governing the gameâ€™s mechanics specified by the professor.
